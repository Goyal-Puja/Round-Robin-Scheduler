# Round-Robin-Scheduler
Implemented a Round Robin Scheduler in C++ which takes input of processes from a file and then executes them. 
Round Robin is one of the most commonly used algorithms in CPU Scheduling. It is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free as all processes get fair share of CPU.
This round-robin scheduler employs time-sharing, giving each job a time slot or quantum.
Example of Preemptive Scheduling.
